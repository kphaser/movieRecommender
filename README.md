# movieRecommender
Movie recommendation system using R.

### Objective
Recommend movies based first on user's current mood and favorite movies from available genres.

The recommender system will use the best recommendation algorithm ("UBCF", "IBCF", "POPULAR", "RANDOM") for surggestions. The data will be preprocessed in order to allow feeding into the algorithms. 

All four types of models will be evaluated using 5-fold cross validation.

The resulting top 10 movies will be recommended. There will be a companion shiny application coming soon.
